    "about": "As a servant leader I am passionate about helping others. I have best used my talents in education and workforce develop areas to help students succeed and achieve their academic and career goals. I have worked closely with faculty, staff, program coordinators, and directors to help students navigate the admissions process. I\u2019ve worked to revamp and manage social media marketing strategies, and educational programs and initiatives, using various creative problem-solving models. Currently, I have the pleasure of working with our Say Yes Buffalo scholars as they learn to navigate our professional world. I am committed to providing professional and innovative experiences for students so they may achieve their goals. I believe our students are our the best investment!\n\nMy life has recently taken a beautiful turn into motherhood where I've welcomed twin girls. I have gained a new perspective and appreciation for life and new passion for black maternal advocacy.\n\nIn my free time, I enjoy hiking, traveling, wine tasting, and reading \u2013 What\u2019s your latest read?",
